# 注意 Warning

Deploying apps using the python37 runtimes requires the use of [Cloud
Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) which is [free for the first 120
minutes of build time per
day](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/#cloud-build-pricing), but still
requires a billing account to be active on a project to in order to be used. 120
minutes of build time is a lot, so most students probably won't go over this
limit if you want to try this.
